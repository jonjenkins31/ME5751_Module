## General Information
 This is the project files team octopus for ME 5751 at Cal poly pomona fall 2022. By jonathan Jenkins.  This Github folder contain the 4 modules, final, and competition files. The goal of this project was to develope motion mapping software for a virtual robot. The code i developed had the following key features: 
- [x] A* algorithm
- [x]  PID Controler for virtual wheels
- [x]  Cost map and Brush Fire Algorithm
- [x] Probabilistic Road Map
